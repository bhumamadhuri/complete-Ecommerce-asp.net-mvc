This project involved the development of an E-Ticketing system that provides users with comprehensive access to a database of movies, including detailed information on actors, actresses, producers, and their associated films. The system was designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a scalable architecture.

The backend was developed in C#, utilizing the Entity Framework ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to facilitate smooth and efficient data access and manipulation. This approach ensured seamless integration with an MSSQL database, allowing for robust data storage and retrieval.
The Entity Framework was particularly instrumental in managing complex relationships between entities such as movies, actors, and producers, thereby streamlining the development process and enhancing overall system performance.
